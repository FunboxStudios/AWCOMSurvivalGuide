AWCOMSurvivalGuide
===================
This repository is host to a variation of the [ActiveWorlds](https://www.activeworlds.com/index.html) User Guide feature. The AWCOM Survival Guide preserves the original User Guide while also adding tips, tricks, and teleports to popular and recommended destinations. The Survival Guide is reguarly synchronized with the [AWCOM website](http://awcom.me).

AWCOMSurvivalGuide
-------------------

The AWCOM Survival Guide is a modification made to the official AW User Guide which enhances it by adding newer, more relevant categories and new features such as wiki inclusion and a comprehensive teleports list. 

This takes the place of the existing user guide, which may be found in the AW tabs menu by pressing F9 and looking under the 'User Guide'/'Help' tab.

The original Ultimate AW User Guide won a Cy Award on November 13, 2010 for Best Bot/Software.

### Installation

The Default.AWH file should be moved to...

    C:/ > ActiveWorlds > Help
    [or]
    C:/ > ActiveWorlds 3D > Help
    
...and replace the existing default.awh file.  You may rename the existing file 'defaultbackup' if you want to preserve it.  ActiveWorlds will need to be restarted for this to take effect.


### Older Versions

Uploads to GitHub are timed in accordance with their release on the AWCOM website. Release notes for versions 2.00 and newer can be found on the AWCOM website. Release notes for versions 1.2 and earlier, under the name Ultimate AW User Guide by Anthony Neace, can be found [here](https://github.com/AnthonyNeace/AWUserGuideUtilities).
